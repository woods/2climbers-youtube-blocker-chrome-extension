# 2climbers-youtube-blocker-chrome-extension

I created this Chrome / Brave extension for my kids, but it's good for me 
too.

It's just a CSS stylesheet for youtube.com that blocks all comments and 
suggested content. You can still browse users and channels, subscribe, and 
watch. But you're more or less in control of what you see.
